# rmtt_driver_ws

The repository is a clone from [rmtt_ros](https://github.com/cavayangtao/rmtt_ros), while some modifications have been made to satisfy our requirement. Please follow this ```readme``` file to complete required configuration.

The ```readme``` file is revised based on the original one.

## Prerequisites
rmtt_node18.py is tested in Ubuntu 18.04/ROS Melodic. An [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) virtual environment is required to manage the python interpreter of this package. Please run the following commands to satisfy running requirements of ```rmtt_node18.py``` :
```
conda create -n py38 python=3.8
pip install robomaster==0.1.1.63
pip install rospkg
pip install pyyaml
pip install scipy
```
Run ```pip install -i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple``` instead of ```pip install``` in China.

## Build on ROS

You can find ```rmtt_driver_ws``` under the repository ```Mono_Drone_Eva```, and please type the following commands to compile it.: 

```
cd ~/Mono_Drone_Eva/rmtt_driver_ws
catkin_make_isolated
```

## Run the Program

After compilation you can start the program. For ```rmtt_driver```, please run
```
  cd ~/Mono_Drone_Eva/rmtt_driver_ws
  conda activate py38
  source devel_isolated/setup.bash
  roslaunch rmtt_driver rmtt_bringup.launch 
```
to activate the tello driver. A drone-view image window will then appear.

For ```rmtt_teleop```, if you want to get the drone off the ground and control it via keyboards, please open a new terminal and type the following commands:

```
  cd ~/Mono_Drone_Eva/rmtt_driver_ws
  conda activate py38
  source devel_isolated/setup.bash
  roslaunch rmtt_teleop rmtt_teleop_key.launch
```
or you can control the drone via joys:

```
  cd ~/Mono_Drone_Eva/rmtt_driver_ws
  conda activate py38
  source devel_isolated/setup.bash
  roslaunch rmtt_teleop rmtt_teleop_joy.launch 
```

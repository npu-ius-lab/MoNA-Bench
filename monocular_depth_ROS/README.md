# ROS Packages for Monocular Depth Estimation
The folder is a collection of 4 ROS packages for monocular depth estimation, includes [MonoDepth](https://github.com/tentone/monodepth), [MiDaS](https://github.com/isl-org/MiDaS), [PackNet_SfM](https://github.com/surfii3z/packnet_sfm_ros) and [SC_DepthV2](https://github.com/YongzhouPan/sc_depth_pl_ros). You can click the specific package to access its homepage. The performance of these algorithms was evaluated in our paper, and we are glad to show our great respect to the packages developers for their contribution to our open-source community.

**It should be noticed that the 4 packages were modified to satisfy our experimental requirements,** and we are willing to share our experience on setup and operation. For more details, please check [monodepth_ros](https://github.com/YongzhouPan/monodepth_ros), [MiDaS_ros](https://github.com/YongzhouPan/MiDaS_ros), [packnet_sfm_ros](https://github.com/YongzhouPan/packnet_sfm_ros), [SC_Depth_pl_ros](https://github.com/YongzhouPan/sc_depth_pl_ros), respectively. 


## Experimental Configuration
We have tested all the packages on `ROS Melodic` for `Ubuntu 18.04`. The CPU of the laptop is *Intel i7-10875H* and the GPU is *NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 Super Max-Q*. The GPU driver version is `450.51.06` and the CUDA version is `11.0`.

## Virtual Environment
We highly recommand you to manage the packages with Anaconda virtual environment.

## Update
The `README` is an initial version and we will improve it with more details in the coming months.
